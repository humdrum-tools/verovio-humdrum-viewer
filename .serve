# You need to first install jekyll to run the VHV documentation website locally.
# See the webpage:
#     https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation
#     https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll
# for instructions on installing it.
#
# This script to run the web server for VHV documenation uses external
# resource (javascript and css files).  Use .serve-local to not depend
# on any external resources (such as when your computer is not connected
# to the internet).
#
# To run from the comand line, type:
#     ./.serve
#
# Then look for the address of the webserver, which should be:
#     http://127.0.0.1:4000
#

bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
